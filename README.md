# LookingGlass

LookingGlass is an API mod targeted at providing tools and systems for mods to render locations in other dimensions.

Since the Minecraft Client has no concept of other dimensions, LookingGlass gives it one and adds systems for the server to send information to clients about worlds other than the one the client is currently in.

# This fork

This fork fixes an issue where SecurityCraft camera monitor will render strange things https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/Angelica/issues/838.

As it is mostly a fix for internal use the mod might not be updated often.
