/**
 * This is a badly approximated "portal render" animator, which makes the camera move based on what direction the player is from some defined point. It doesn't
 * do quite what it was meant to, but it's neat enough looking, so I'll leave it be. It does make a view look more "alive" or 3D, so if you just want a slightly
 * animated view that doesn't look like you could walk through it, then this works great. It produces an effect more akin to Harry Potter's portraits than it
 * does to Portal's portals.
